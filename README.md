# DS-Algos-DynamicProgramming

## Purpose

To get a better understanding of the implementation of abstract data types in C++ I will be implementing my own data structures that perform very similar to the ones in the STL. I will also be practicing dynamic programming problems to get a better understanding of how to solve them and implementing algorithms found in the STL.
